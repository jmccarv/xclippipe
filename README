xclippipe pastes the contents of an X selection (PRIMARY and/or CLIPBOARD)
to its stdout and/or the stdin of another process

xclippipe creates a window and waits for keyboard or mouse button presses
to tell it what action to take.  There are three possible actions:
  action.exit - exit the program
  action.clipboard - paste from the X CLIPBOARD selection (usually ctrl-v)
  action.primary - paste from the X PRIMARY selection (usually middle mouse button)

You can configure what keys and buttons are bound to these actions on the
command line or in your .Xresources.

Key and button names are case insensitive

-name sets the program name that is used to look up X resources.
If no -name is present on the command line, the name of this executable
will be used.


EXAMPLES
1.  Paste to stdout.
    Paste from CLIPBOARD on ctrl-v
    and from PRIMARY on mouse button 2 (middle mouse button)
    Exit on Escape key

    xclippipe -stdout -action.clipboard ctrl+v -action.primary button2 -action.exit escape

2.  For each paste event, run a process (cat) sending the selection data to its stdin
    Paste from PRIMARY on mouse button 2 or ctrl-alt-p
    Paste from CLIPBOARD on mouse button 3 or ctrl-v
    Exit on ctrl-d or Escape or mouse button 1

    xclippipe -run 'cat >> $HOME/xclippipe.log' -action.clipboard 'ctrl+v|button3' -action.primary 'button2|ctrl+mod2+p' -action.exit 'ctrl+d|escape|button1'

3.  Paste to stdout and explicitely disable any 'run' commands that might be in your .Xresources
    Disable appending a newline to output, set the background color to green,
    turn off window manager decorations (borders), and run above other windows

    xclippipe -stdout -run '' +nl -bg green -borderless -above

4.  Use debugging to see what keys and buttons you're pressing to help know what to pass for actions

    xclippipe +stdout +run -debug

Notes:
When configuring keys with modifiers, any modifiers you don't want to require,
just leave them off.  xclippipe will ignore any non-specified modifiers.
For example, if you set
  -action.exit: ctrl+d
xclippipe will exit when ctrl and 'd' are pressed at the same time
regardless of what other modifiers are set
(so it would also exit on ctrl+alt+d)

Default Parameters:
  -g 100x100 -bg black -title xclippipe -stdout -flush-stdout -nl -action.exit escape -action.primary button2 -action.clipboard ctrl+v

The defaults are used when no other resource of the same name
is found either from the command line or from the
X server (.Xresources, etc)
